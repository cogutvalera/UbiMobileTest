HOW TO CREATE NEW LEVEL:

1. Just copy any scene from current levels and add it to the Build Settings.
2. Open new scene and select `Level` game object.
3. On `Level` game object you can change laps per level, ratings (seconds, stars) per lap, checkpoints and web-server.
4. You can create/transform/move/delete different obstacles, surfaces and checkpoints just as you wish right in your new level scene.
5. Do not forget to add all checkpoints in right order right into list of the `Level` game object.
